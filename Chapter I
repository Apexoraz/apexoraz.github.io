  <h1>Chapter I – The Inner Kingdom</h1>
  <h2>From "The Wisdom of Life" by Arthur Schopenhauer</h2>

  <div class="quote">
    “Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.” — Arthur Schopenhauer

    <h2>A Journey Inward: Where True Success Begins</h2>
    <p>
      In a world obsessed with image, wealth, and applause, Schopenhauer offers a timeless, piercing reminder: true success has nothing to do with what you possess or how others see you—and everything to do with who you are when no one is watching.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Life Divided into Three Domains:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">What a man is</span> — character, intelligence, health, temperament, soul.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">What a man has</span> — property, money, material comfort.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">How a man is seen</span> — reputation, honor, social status, fame.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Revelation</h2>
    <p>
      Only the first—what we are—is truly ours. It lives with us, shapes every thought, filters every experience, and determines whether we see the world as a prison or a temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessions can be taken. Reputation fades. But your inner essence—clarity, depth, strength—travels with you through storms, silence, and solitude.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💭 Imagine This:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A man with wealth but no peace…</li>
      <li>A man praised by all, but tormented by boredom…</li>
      <li>A man crowned with honors, yet terrified of being alone with his thoughts…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are the illusions of success.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      Now picture another man—perhaps unknown, perhaps poor—sitting quietly, thinking deeply, unshaken by chaos. He is rich with awareness, alive in solitude, lit from within. That, Schopenhauer teaches, is the sovereign of his own life.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔑 A Hidden Key to a Powerful Life:</h2>
    <p>
      Build the kind of self no one can give you, and no one can take. Let your mind be a palace. Let your character be your crown. Everything else is theater.
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>🕯️ Wisdom to Carry With You:</h2>
    <div class="quote">
      “To possess a great mind, to enjoy solitude, to find meaning within—this is a higher fortune than wealth or fame.” — Arthur Schopenhauer
    </div>

    <h2>💡 Apexoraz Insight</h2>
    <p>
      Modern minds seek more—more success, more status, more approval. But the secret is less.<br>
      Less noise. More depth.<br>
      Less chasing. More becoming.<br>
      Less applause. More awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you cultivate the soul, you master the stage of life.<br>
      When you rule your mind, you no longer need a throne.<br>
      When you find meaning within, the world becomes a mirror—not a master.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✨ At Apexoraz, we don’t teach you how to win the game.<br>
      We help you leave it—and design your own.<br>
      Follow the path of Schopenhauer, and unlock the life no one else sees… yet.
